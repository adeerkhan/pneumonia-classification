Medical Image-Based Deep Learning App
This repository contains the code and data for deploying a Python-based application that utilizes deep learning algorithms to identify medical diagnoses and treatable diseases from image data. The application is deployed using Streamlit, making it accessible to anyone who wishes to use it for disease diagnosis and management.

Overview
This app is based on the research paper titled "Identifying Medical Diagnoses and Treatable Diseases by Image-Based Deep Learning" (source: Cell). The paper discusses the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) to revolutionize disease diagnosis and management by rapidly reviewing immense amounts of medical images and performing complex classifications that may be challenging for human experts.

The paper proposes a deep learning approach that utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image analysis and classification. The CNN architecture allows the model to automatically learn relevant features from the images, eliminating the need for handcrafted object segmentation and manual feature engineering.

Application and Focus
The primary focus of this application is to demonstrate the implementation of the research paper's deep learning algorithms for diagnosing medical conditions using image data. The model is particularly effective in analyzing retinal Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) images, a critical imaging modality for guiding the diagnosis and treatment of various eye diseases, including age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and diabetic macular edema.

By deploying this app using Streamlit, we enable users to interact with the deep learning model in a user-friendly way. Users can upload their own retinal OCT images, and the model will provide real-time diagnoses for AMD and diabetic macular edema based on the image analysis.

Getting Started
To use the application, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine.

Install the required Python dependencies using the following command:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Download the necessary data from the provided sources (if applicable):

Data from https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(18)30154-5#secsectitle0065
Data from https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/rscbjbr9sj/2

Once the dependencies are installed and the data is set up (if required), run the application using Streamlit:

streamlit run app.py

The app should launch in your web browser, allowing you to interact with it and perform medical diagnoses using the image-based deep learning algorithms.

Conclusion
This Streamlit application showcases the capabilities of the deep learning model presented in the research paper for diagnosing medical conditions based on retinal OCT images. The user-friendly interface makes it accessible to healthcare professionals and researchers, allowing them to obtain rapid and accurate diagnoses using AI-powered image analysis.
